# Next.js Blank Page Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet puzzling issue in Next.js applications where the page renders blank, with no obvious errors in the browser's console. The problem stems from an unexpected behavior or configuration within Next.js itself rather than a typical syntax or runtime error.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the blank page in the browser.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing Next.js configurations, including the `_app.js` file to ensure proper component rendering or troubleshooting any potential conflicts with other dependencies in your application.   The solution provided may involve minor changes to your application structure or might reveal a conflict with a third-party library.
